Dear Colleague,

Re: Mrs Jane Smith, DoB: 15/03/1960, NHS No: 123 456 7890

I would be grateful if you could see this patient regarding chronic right knee pain.

Mrs Smith has been experiencing progressive right knee pain for the past six months. The pain is worse on weight-bearing and after prolonged sitting, and she reports hearing clicking sounds when walking. She has tried paracetamol and ibuprofen with minimal benefit, and the pain is now significantly impacting her ability to work as a teacher.

Her past medical history includes hypertension, well-controlled on ramipril 5mg once daily. She has no known drug allergies. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially.

Examination revealed mild joint effusion and tenderness over the medial joint line. There is reduced range of movement with flexion limited to 110 degrees. X-ray shows moderate degenerative changes with joint space narrowing.

I would be grateful for your assessment and management recommendations, including consideration for physiotherapy or surgical intervention.

Thank you for seeing this patient.

Yours sincerely,

[Doctor's name]
[Practice name]`;
